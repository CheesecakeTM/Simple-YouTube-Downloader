# Simple Youtube Downloader

![](.git-images/Screenshot.png "Preview of the app, as of now")

## Things I want to add
- drop-down menu to choose between 'audio' and 'video'
- possibility to choose the path for the download
- cooler UX/UI

## Why this project?
I wanted to learn Python for some time and this is my <br>
first project. Building something you'll use or other <br>
people will use is rewarding ^-^
